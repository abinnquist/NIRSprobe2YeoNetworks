# NIRSprobe2YeoNetworks
 To determine the Yeo netowrk of each channel in a NIRS probe montage. Must have the MNI coordinates for each channel already made (see fNIRSpreprocessing). Based off of the work from Thomas Yeo's lab on resting state networks and location specifics pulled from their Github (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Yeo2011_fcMRI_clustering).
 
 # How to Use
 Use the probe2network.m script to change study specific locations and run the function getyeonames.m. Make sure inputs are changed for study specific details.
